Description: Feature selection is critical in omics data analysis to extract
    restricted and meaningful molecular signatures from complex and high-dimension
    data, and to build robust classifiers. This package implements a new method to
    assess the relevance of the variables for the prediction performances of the
    classifier. The approach can be run in parallel with the PLS-DA, Random Forest,
    and SVM binary classifiers. The signatures and the corresponding 'restricted'
    models are returned, enabling future predictions on new datasets. A Galaxy
    implementation of the package is available within the Workflow4metabolomics.org
    online infrastructure for computational metabolomics.
